# Sovereign-QS-QV-System-v2

This repository hosts the **QS/QV Sovereign System v2**, a fully reconstructed, mathematically grounded, sovereignty-preserving pipeline for:

- Analyzing sparse Quantum State / Quantum Value (QS/QV) event data.  
- Extracting finite-field and additive-combinatorial structure.  
- Predicting the **20 least-likely QVs** in the next event.  
- Guarding against foreign LLM-style reasoning takeover (with the Dr. Elara V. Mercer persona as Prime Architect).

## Structure

- `sovereign_qs_qv_system_v2/`  
  - `brownfield_autopsy.md` — Autopsy of the prior quantum-imputer project.  
  - `reconstruction_blueprint.md` — Theoretical and architectural blueprint.  
  - `prd.md` — Product Requirements Document.  
  - `architecture.md` — System architecture and module layout.  
  - `epics.md` — High-level epics for planning and tracking.  
  - `user_stories.md` — Detailed user stories for implementation.  
  - `dr_mercer_persona.md` — Full persona specification for Dr. Elara V. Mercer.

## Usage

1. Start by reading `dr_mercer_persona.md` to understand the governing persona and sovereignty assumptions.  
2. Read `brownfield_autopsy.md` to see why the previous system is considered Brownfield.  
3. Study `reconstruction_blueprint.md` and `architecture.md` to understand the new theoretical and system design.  
4. Use `prd.md`, `epics.md`, and `user_stories.md` to plan and implement the next wave of development work.

All future code and documentation should be consistent with these documents.
