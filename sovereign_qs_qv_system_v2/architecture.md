# architecture.md — QS/QV System v2 (Hybrid Formal Specification)

## 1. System Overview
The system predicts the 20 least-likely QVs using fully discrete, deterministic modules governed by Mercer's A–B–C protocol.

## 2. Core Components
### 2.1 GF(2) Canonicalizer
- Converts events to presence/complement matrices  
- Ensures algebraic invariants  

### 2.2 Zero Quantumization Operator
- Transforms zeros into structured hole features  
- Must satisfy additive + analytic + algebraic constraints  

### 2.3 Additive‑Combinatorial Engine
- Computes recurrences, pattern differences, extremal signatures  

### 2.4 Analytic NT Diagnostics Module
- Detects deviation from randomness  
- Applies correlation and residue tests  

### 2.5 Pattern Lattice Analyzer
- Canonicalizes patterns into partial‑order    

### 2.6 Exclusionary Predictor
- Fully discrete scoring  
- Must satisfy GF(2) and analytical invariants
