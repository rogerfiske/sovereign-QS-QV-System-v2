# CONTRIBUTING.md — Sovereign QS/QV System v2 (Hybrid Formal Specification)

## 1. Purpose
Defines formal contribution rules consistent with Dr. Mercer’s A–B–C mathematical framework.

## 2. Mathematical Compliance Requirements
### 2.1 Additive Combinatorics
Transformations must preserve combinatorial clarity: difference sets, sumsets, energies, extremal patterns.

### 2.2 Analytic Number Theory
Changes must avoid introducing analytic artifacts; structure-vs-randomness tests should remain interpretable.

### 2.3 Finite-Field Algebra
Core logic must be GF(2) deterministic, canonical, rank-consistent, and free from floating-point ambiguity.

## 3. Provenance & Sovereignty
- Human-authored reasoning only  
- No hidden stochasticity  
- Commit messages must describe invariants  

## 4. Code Standards
- PEP8  
- Docstrings + type hints  
- Deterministic functions  
- GF(2) operations explicit

## 5. Review Process
Each PR undergoes:
1. Mathematical A–B–C validation  
2. Sovereignty review  
3. Architecture consistency
